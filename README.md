The Amazon.com clone project is a web application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It mimics Amazon's e-commerce functionality, allowing users to add items to their cart, 
dynamically updating prices based on quantity, and selecting delivery options.
The project emphasizes a user-friendly interface, responsive design, and practical application of front-end development skills for a hands-on learning experience.
